    "## Decisions and Uncertainty \n",
    "We have seen several examples of assessing models that involve chance, by comparing observed data to the predictions made by the models. In all of our examples, there has been no doubt about whether the data were consistent with the model's predictions. The data were either very far away from the predictions, or very close to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "But outcomes are not always so clear cut. How far is \"far\"? Exactly what does \"close\" mean? While these questions don't have universal answers, there are guidelines and conventions that you can follow. In this section we will describe some of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "But first let us develop a general framework of decision making, into which all our examples will fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we have developed while assessing models are some of the fundamental concepts of statistical tests of hypotheses. Using statistical tests as a way of making decisions is standard in many fields and has a standard terminology. Here is the sequence of the steps in most statistical tests, along with some terminology and examples. You will see that they are consistent with the sequence of steps we have used for assessing models.\n",

    "## Step 1: The Hypotheses \n",
    "All statistical tests attempt to choose between two views of the world. Specifically, the choice is between two views about how the data were generated. These two views are called hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis. This is a clearly defined model about chances. It says that the data were generated at random under clearly specified assumptions about the randomness. The word \"null\" reinforces the idea that if the data look different from what the null hypothesis predicts, the difference is due to nothing but chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a practical perspective, the null hypothesis is a hypothesis under which you can simulate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example about Mendel's model for the colors of pea plants, the null hypothesis is that the assumptions of his model are good: each plant has a 75% chance of having purple flowers, independent of all other plants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under this hypothesis, we were able to simulate random samples, by using sample_proportions(929, [0.75, 0.25]). We used a sample size of 929 because that's the number of plants Mendel grew.\n",
    "\n",
    "The alternative hypothesis. This says that some reason other than chance made the data differ from the predictions of the model in the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example about Mendel's plants, the alternative hypothesis is simply that his model isn't good.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: The Test Statistic \n",
    "In order to decide between the two hypothesis, we must choose a statistic that we can use to make the decision. This is called the test statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example of Mendel's plants, our statistic was the absolute difference between the sample percent and 75% which was predicted by his model.\n",
    "\n",
    "∣∣sample percent of purple-flowering plants−75∣∣\n",
    " \n",
    "To see how to make the choice in general, look at the alternative hypothesis. What values of the statistic will make you think that the alternative hypothesis is a better choice than the null?\n",
    "\n",
    "If the answer is \"big values,\" you might have a good choice of statistic.\n",
    "So also if the answer is \"small values.\"\n",
    "But if the answer is \"both big values and small values,\" we recommend that you look again at your statistic and see if taking an absolute value can change the answer to just \"big values\".\n",
    "In the case of the pea plants, a sample percent of around 75% will be consistent with the model, but percents much bigger or much less than 75 will make you think that the model isn't good. This indicates that the statistic should be the distance between the sample percent and 75, that is, the absolute value of the difference between them. Big values of the distance will make you lean towards the alternative."

    "The test statistic is simulated based on the assumptions of the model in the null hypothesis. That model involves chance, so the statistic comes out differently when you simulate it multiple times.\n",

    "\n",
    "If the two are consistent with each other, then the observed test statistic is in line with what the null hypothesis predicts. In other words, the test does not point towards the alternative hypothesis; the null hypothesis is better supported by the data. This was the case with the assessment of Mendel's model.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if the two are not consistent with each other, as is the case in our example about Alameda County jury panels, then the data do not support the null hypothesis. That is why we concluded that the jury panels were not selected at random. Something other than chance affected their composition.\n",

In the example about pea flowers, it is just as clear that the observed statistic is consistent with the distribution that the null predicts. So in both of the examples, it is clear which hypothesis to choose.\n",
    "\n",
    "But sometimes the decision is not so clear. Whether the observed test statistic is consistent with its predicted distribution under the null hypothesis is a matter of judgment. We recommend that you provide your judgment along with the value of the test statistic and a graph of its predicted distribution under the null.
